# Klash WebCache
I love the way MUI's libraries look - time to use them.

This one project provides the source for @klashdevelopment's website, shkrmishstore, and brainbase's frontend redesign.

Add the root directory to your path if you are on linux! It will let you use the `run` builtin script to quickrun project using it's command.

Usage is `run <project> [type]`. Project can be:
- klashsite (klash, k, ks)
- shkrmishstore (shkr, ss)
- brainbaseui (bb, br)
- empires (de)
- counterfeitcontent
- notify
- fluent-test

while type can be:
- run (or no 2nd arg)
- launch (Launches new app with fly)
- deploy (Deploys update to existing app with fly)
