# MuiTP
I love the way MUI's libraries look - time to use them.

This one project provides the source for @klashdevelopment's website, shkrmishstore, and brainbase's frontend redesign.

Add the directory to your path if you are on linux! It will let you use the `run` builtin script to quickrun project using it's command.


Usage is `run <project>`. Project can be brainbaseui (brainbase/bb/br), placeholder (placeholder/p), placeholder (placeholder/p), placeholder (placeholder/p), or placeholder (placeholder/p).
